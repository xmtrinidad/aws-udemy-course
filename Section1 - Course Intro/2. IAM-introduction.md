# IAM (Identify and Access Management)

* AWS security is here
  * Users
  * Groups
  * Roles

* Root account should never be used (and shared)
* Users must be created with proper permissions
* IAM is at the center of AWS
* Policies are written in JSON


- Users
  - Usually a physical person

- Groups
  - functions (admins, devops, etc)
  - Teams (engineering, design, etc)

- Roles
  - Internal usage within AWS resources

**Policies (JSON Documents) define what each of the above can and cannot do**

--

* IAM has a **global** view
* Permissions are governed by *Policies*
* Multi Factor Auth can be setup
* IAM has predefined "managed policies"
* It's best to give users the minimal amount of permissions they need to perform their job (least privilege principles)

* One IAM **User** per PHYSICAL PERSON
* One IAM **Role** per Application
* IAM credentials should never be shared
* Never write IAM credentials in code
* Never use the ROOT account except for initial setup
* Never use ROOT IAM credentials
