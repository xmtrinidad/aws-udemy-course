# What is EC2

The basis of AWS

* EC2 is one of the most popular AWS offerings
* Mainly consists in the capability of:
  * Renting VMs (EC2)
  * Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  * Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  * Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

* Fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

# Security Groups

* Fundamental of network security in AWS
* Control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Machines
* Uner Network & Security
* Basically firewalls on EC2 instances
* They regulate
  * Access to Ports
  * Authorize IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
  * Control of inbound network (from other to the network)
  * Control of outbound network (from instane to other)
* Security groups can be attached to multiple instances
* Locked down to a region /VPC combination
* Lives outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it
* **It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access**

# Installing Apache on EC2 Example (Amazon Linux 2)

* Log into instance VIA SSH
* sudo su to elevate rights to root
* yum update -y to update instance
* yum install -y httpd.x86_84
* systemctl start httpd.service
* systemctl enable httpd.service (enabled across reboots)
* Enable HTTP traffic in the instance Security Group
* Visit public IPv4 address
